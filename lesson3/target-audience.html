            need to know
            what the weather will be that day. The students donâ€™t want to get caught in a snowstorm without a coat, so they look
            up the weather forecast whenever they want to go outside. </p>

        <p class='body-paragraphs'>

            <ul class="scenarios">
                <li>Scenario #1: </br> Cameron has college courses all day starting at 9am and ending at 7pm. She leaves when it is light
                    outside, but it gets dark before she is done with class. Cameron wants to know how cold it will get
                    after the
                    sun goes down so she know if she needs to bring a jacket with her to class. She uses her phone to
                    check the
                    weather periodically throughout the day and right before she leaves her class to walk home.
                </li>
            </br>
                <li>
                    Scenario #2: </br>Cameron wants to wear her hair down tomorrow. She checks the weather to see if it will be windy or
                    not, then she decides what hairstyle would work the best.
                </li>
            </br>
                <li>Scenario #3: </br>Spencer has a 7 a.m. CIT class that he walks to from his apartment. After class he likes to take a
                    walk around campus before heading back to his apartment. He checks the weather using his computer
                    every night
                    before class to see what to wear in the morning and so he can be prepared for his walk after class.
                </li>
            </br>
                <li>Scenario #4: </br>Spencer walks his dog as often as he can. He does not plan in advance when he is going out for a
                    walk.
                    Because he doesn't schedule walking his dog, he wants to be able to easily see the current weather.
                </li>
            </br>
                <li>
                    Scenario #5: </br>Spencer and his roommates like playing Spike Ball. They only play outside when the weather is nice
                    and above 65 degrees.
                    Spencer is in charge of checking the weather to see what days of the week would be best for playing
                    outside.
