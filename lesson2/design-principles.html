                <p class="paragraphs">Contrast is “the state of being strikingly different from something else in juxtaposition or close association”. 
                    It adds visual appeal while providing structure. Oddpears.com, a company that sells socks, 
                    demonstrates contrast on their website. The deep blue navigation bar stands out against the 
                    bright white background. The contrast in colors helps the viewer differentiate between 
                    information on the page.</p>

                <p class="paragraphs">White space may seem like an afterthought, but it is one of the most important 
                     design aspects that every web developer needs to consider. White space, or negative space,
                     is the area of a web page that remains empty. It gives the viewers eye a place to rest. 
                     SOUP Agency’s website is a perfect example of using white space. The homepage uses white space to
                     keep items separated from each other. It is easy for viewers to see which items have a relationship. </p>

                <h3>Alignment</h3>
                <img id="oddpear" src="images/oddPear.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the website Odd Pear demonstrating alignment." style="width: 200px">
                <br> <a href="https://www.oddpears.com/collections/casual-socks">oddpear.com</a>
                <p class="paragraphs">Another design aspect that many web developers use is alignment. 
                    Alignment means “in a straight line, or in correct or appropriate relative positions”. 
                    Alignment creates a cohesive website and overall design.
                    The website TypeForm uses alignment on its home page, as well as throughout the website. 
                    The text is all aligned with each other and with the “sign up” button. 
                    The items at the top of the web page are aligned horizontally. </p>
